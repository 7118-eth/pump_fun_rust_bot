- **Token Filtering**: Filter tokens by name or creator address
- **Retry Mechanism**: Configurable retry attempts with wait times
- **Cleanup Options**: Automated or manual account closure

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Solana CLI tools
- Solana wallet with SOL for trading

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pump_fun_rust_bot.git
   cd pump_fun_rust_bot
   ```

2. Build the project
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file in the `bots/` directory. Example structure:

```yaml
name: "MyRustBot"
enabled: true
rpc_endpoint: "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
wss_endpoint: "wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
private_key: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_BS58_HERE"

trade:
  buy_amount: 0.001  # SOL
  buy_slippage: 0.25  # 25%
  sell_slippage: 0.25  # 25%
  extreme_fast_mode: false
  extreme_fast_token_amount: 30

filters:
  listener_type: "logs"  # or "geyser", "block"
  match_string: null  # Optional: e.g., "PEPE"
  bro_address: null  # Optional: Creator address to filter by
  marry_mode: false
  yolo_mode: true  # Continuous trading

# geyser configuration (for Geyser listener)
# priority_fees configuration
# retries configuration
# timing configuration
# cleanup configuration
```

See the example config file in `bots/bot-sniper-1-geyser.yaml` for a full configuration example.

## Usage

Run the bot with:

```
cargo run --release -- bots/your-config.yaml
```

Or use the compiled binary:

```
./target/release/pump_fun_rust_bot bots/your-config.yaml
```

If no config path is provided, the bot will look for `bots/bot-sniper-1-geyser.yaml` by default.

## Architecture

- **Core**: Solana client, wallet, and utility functions
- **Monitoring**: Token listeners (logs, Geyser, block)
- **Trading**: Token buying and selling logic
- **Cleanup**: Account cleanup utilities
- **Utils**: Configuration and logging utilities
