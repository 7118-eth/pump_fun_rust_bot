# pump.fun Liberation üöÄ

A high-performance Solana trading bot for the Pump.fun platform, written in Rust that prioritizes user sovereignty and democratized trading access.

## Overview

This bot is designed to monitor and trade tokens on the Pump.fun platform on Solana. It provides various strategies for token detection, buying, and selling with configurable parameters for different trading styles.

## Project Philosophy

In a space where most trading solutions are centralized, expensive, or potentially malicious:

- **User Sovereignty**: You maintain complete control over your private keys and funds
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent codebase with no hidden functionality
- **Self-Custody**: Unlike centralized alternatives, your funds remain in your control at all times
- **Free Access**: No percentage fees, no subscriptions, democratizing access to high-performance trading
- **Security First**: Designed to protect users from the "dark forest" of exploitative trading tools
- **Decentralized**: Run the bot on your own hardware with your own RPC endpoints

We believe the Solana ecosystem needs more trustless tools that don't require users to sacrifice security for performance.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

**IMPORTANT:** This project is in a **very early development stage** and is largely untested. The dependencies may not be up-to-date, and the code requires significant work before being production-ready.

### Current Status
This is an experimental implementation with limited functionality. Use at your own risk and only with funds you can afford to lose.

### Future Vision
The long-term vision for pump.fun Liberation is to evolve into a comprehensive open-source solution with:

- Trusted compute environments to ensure security
- Optional cloud-hosted services (paid) for non-technical users
- Maintained philosophical commitment to democratization

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to democratize access to trading opportunities that have historically been limited to insiders and those with technical expertise. While pump.fun and similar platforms may ultimately resemble wash trading or casino-like environments with zero-sum outcomes, we believe everyone deserves equal access to participate according to their own decisions.

By leveling the playing field, we hope to eventually reduce the economic incentives of such trading environments and help the crypto space evolve beyond speculative activities toward more productive use cases.

**Remember:** No financial gains are guaranteed. Use responsibly.

## Features

- **Multiple Listener Types**: Monitor tokens via transaction logs, Geyser API, or block data
- **Configurable Trading Strategies**:
  - Buy/sell with customizable slippage settings
  - "Marry mode" to buy tokens without selling
  - "YOLO mode" for continuous trading of multiple tokens
  - Extreme fast mode for quick trading response
- **Priority Fee Management**: Dynamic and fixed priority fees with configurable caps
- **Token Filtering**: Filter tokens by name or creator address
- **Retry Mechanism**: Configurable retry attempts with wait times
- **Cleanup Options**: Automated or manual account closure

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Solana CLI tools
- Solana wallet with SOL for trading

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pump_fun_rust_bot.git
   cd pump_fun_rust_bot
   ```

2. Build the project
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Configuration

Create a YAML configuration file in the `bots/` directory. Example structure:

```yaml
name: "MyRustBot"
enabled: true
rpc_endpoint: "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
wss_endpoint: "wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
private_key: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_BS58_HERE"

trade:
  buy_amount: 0.001  # SOL
  buy_slippage: 0.25  # 25%
  sell_slippage: 0.25  # 25%
  extreme_fast_mode: false
  extreme_fast_token_amount: 30

filters:
  listener_type: "logs"  # or "geyser", "block"
  match_string: null  # Optional: e.g., "PEPE"
  bro_address: null  # Optional: Creator address to filter by
  marry_mode: false
  yolo_mode: true  # Continuous trading

# geyser configuration (for Geyser listener)
# priority_fees configuration
# retries configuration
# timing configuration
# cleanup configuration
```

See the example config file in `bots/bot-sniper-1-geyser.yaml` for a full configuration example.

## Usage

Run the bot with:

```
cargo run --release -- bots/your-config.yaml
```

Or use the compiled binary:

```
./target/release/pump_fun_rust_bot bots/your-config.yaml
```

If no config path is provided, the bot will look for `bots/bot-sniper-1-geyser.yaml` by default.

## Architecture

- **Core**: Solana client, wallet, and utility functions
- **Monitoring**: Token listeners (logs, Geyser, block)
- **Trading**: Token buying and selling logic
- **Cleanup**: Account cleanup utilities
- **Utils**: Configuration and logging utilities

## Project Status

This project is currently in **early development stage**. Here's the status of each component:

### Implemented Components ‚úÖ

- **Core Architecture**: The overall structure and module organization is in place
- **Configuration**: The YAML-based configuration system is fully implemented
- **Logging**: Basic logging functionality works with console output
- **LogsListener**: Basic Solana WebSocket listener structure for monitoring token creation events

### Partially Implemented Components ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Token Monitoring**: Basic event subscription framework exists, but needs log parsing improvements
- **PumpTrader**: The main trading orchestration is structured, but missing transaction handlers
- **TokenBuyer**: Stub implementation exists but requires transaction building and execution logic
- **TokenSeller**: Similar to TokenBuyer, requires actual implementation of selling transactions
- **Priority Fee Management**: Structure defined but implementation is incomplete

### Missing Components ‚ùå

- **Geyser Integration**: The Geyser module is empty and needs to be implemented
- **Bonding Curve Manager**: Placeholder only, needs actual curve calculations
- **CleanupManager**: Placeholder structure only, functionality missing
- **Advanced Trading Logic**: Timing strategies, token age verification
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Test Suite**: Unit and integration tests

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
- [x] Project structure and configuration

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are the top priorities if you'd like to help:

1. Complete the token log parsing in `logs_listener.rs`
2. Implement transaction building in `buyer.rs` and `seller.rs`
3. Develop the bonding curve calculations in `curve.rs`
4. Implement the Geyser integration
5. Add proper tests for each module

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Trading cryptocurrency involves significant risk. This bot is provided for educational purposes only. Always:

1. Test with small amounts first
2. Never share your private keys
3. Understand the risks involved
4. Be aware of network fees and slippage
